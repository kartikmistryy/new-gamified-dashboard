## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Component reuse: Must reuse existing dashboard components from `components/dashboard/` rather than creating new ones
- Mirror metric categories: Use identical categories (Star, Time Bomb, Key Role, Bottleneck, Risky, Legacy) for members
- Member mocks match team structure: Enables component reuse without refactoring
- Identical charts with different data: Avoids code duplication; maintains UX consistency
